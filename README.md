##Coffee Order List Challenge

This is an challenge that i did while in CodeNation by collaborating with Ross Burrows

The changes we made were:

- Added the ability to delete orders
- Added a payment roulette to randomly pick a name from the list
- Added a reset button to start again once the previous list was completed
- Added a way to finalize the order when the roulette was started
- Added a way to sumbit the input using the 'ENTER' key
- Added a coffee size input
- Moved the completed orders code into its own component
- Changed/added css
- Made the names be printed in caps
